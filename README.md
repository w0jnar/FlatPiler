# FlatPiler
For fun version of the Compiler Project in C#.

Written for my own enjoyment, based heavily Professor Labouseur's Project for his Compilers class.

Grammar is here: http://www.labouseur.com/courses/compilers/grammar.pdf

-Minor changes: 

                -Less of a need of verbose output.

                -Might not make visual CST and AST (have not crossed that bridge yet).
                
                -Might do unlimited code gen (also have not crossed that bridge yet).

Written in C#, with a basis CATpiler, this compiler is primarily just for my sake, 
as an exporation of C#, and to gain more experience with the language, as I felt I did 
not have enough experience with the Syntax.
